# Abstract
This study uses data analytics and machine learning to improve customer profiling and conversion optimization in freight CRM, with Tudor Freight International as a case study. Descriptive analytics explored key metrics such as quote volumes, transport modes, destinations, and conversion ratesâ€”revealing that 87.2% of quotes convert into clients and identifying significant seasonal and operator-based patterns. Air transport was the most quoted mode. Using K-means clustering, three customer segments were uncovered based on cost and timing, linked to specific operators. The findings offer actionable insights to enhance segmentation, improve service personalization, and optimize freight operations.

# Supply chain and Logistics sector
Logistics companies increasingly rely on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to centralize and streamline the collection, organization, and analysis of critical customer data. CRM systems capture valuable information such as customer inquiries, quote requests, shipment preferences, and feedback, all of which are essential for understanding customer behavior and demand patterns. By leveraging this data, logistics companies gain deep insights into customer needs and preferences, enabling them to tailor their services more effectively. The strategic application of CRM data supports refined customer segmentation, optimized sales strategies, and enhanced service offerings. This approach, in turn, improves operational decision-making, enables more accurate demand forecasting, and drives business growth while fostering long-term, sustainable customer relationships.
